# JS Fun in the Library

## Overview

As part of our first project at Turing, we were assigned Fun in the Library, unit testing. During this project, we gained experience working with variables, primitive data types, looping, arrays, and objects. 

## Learning goals

  - Understand what JavaScript primitives are, and how/when to use them
  - Practice using objects and arrays, including for loops
  - Understand JavaScript data types and how/when to use them
  - Write functions that require conditional logic, parameters/arguments, and return
  - Read and understand unit tests, and pass them

## Setup

  - Fork this project to your own Github account
  - clone the repository to your local machine
  - `cd` into the project
  - run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies
